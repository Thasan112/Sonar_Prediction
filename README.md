# Sonar_Prediction
This project uses sonar data and machine learning techniques to classify and predict different types of rocks and minerals based on their acoustic signatures. By analyzing the reflections of sound waves from subsurface structures, the system can identify geological materials with high accuracy.


# 🔍 Sonar-Based Rock and Mineral Prediction

This project leverages sonar data and machine learning techniques to predict and classify different types of rocks and minerals based on their unique acoustic signatures. It provides a non-invasive and scalable solution for subsurface exploration in geological, marine, and mining applications.

📁 Project Structure
This project follows a structured approach to implement and evaluate a logistic regression model. Below are the major steps involved:

a) 📚 Importing Libraries
All the necessary Python libraries such as:

numpy

pandas

sklearn (for model building, training, and evaluation)

matplotlib / seaborn (optional for visualizations)

b) 📊 Data Collection and Processing
Load the dataset using pandas.

Handle missing values, if any.

Normalize or scale the data (if required).

Prepare the input and target variables.

c) ✂️ Split the Data into Train and Test
Use train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection to split the dataset.

Typically, a common split is 80% for training and 20% for testing.

d) 🤖 Training the Logistic Regression Model
Train a Logistic Regression model using sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.

Fit the model on the training data.

e) ✅ Accuracy Score of the Model
Use sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score to evaluate how well the model performs on the test data.

Optionally, include a confusion matrix and classification report.

f) 🔮 Prediction
Make predictions on new/unseen data.

Optionally, allow user input to test the model interactively.
